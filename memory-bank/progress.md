# Progress: Fluidity AI Website

## What Works
- Website structure with Astro.js and Tailwind CSS
- Navigation and footer components
- Services pages
- Team pages
- Contact form with name, email, and message fields
- Formspree integration for email processing
- Form validation for required fields
- Success and error messages for form submission

## What's Left to Build
- Potentially add more fields to the contact form if needed
- Consider adding a CAPTCHA if spam becomes an issue
- Improve error handling for edge cases
- Add more comprehensive form validation if needed

## Current Status
- The contact page is implemented and functional at the /contact route
- The contact form collects name, email, and message
- Formspree is integrated for email processing
- Navigation and footer links point to the contact page

## Known Issues
- Form submission needs to be tested in a production environment
- Success and error messages may need styling adjustments

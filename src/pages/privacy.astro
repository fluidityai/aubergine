    <p>
      We do not collect any personal information directly from users. However,

    <h5 class="my-2 text-xl text-onyx-500">3. Google Analytics</h5>

      of our website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and
      stored by Google on servers in the United States. Google may also transfer
      this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where

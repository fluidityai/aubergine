## What it is

The Independent Dispute Resolution (IDR) process, established under the No Surprises Act, allows healthcare providers to challenge inadequate out-of-network reimbursements and pursue fair compensation. It involves a neutral third party who reviews the case and makes a binding decision on the appropriate payment amount, especially for out-of-network services.

### What we do

Fluidity-ai supports providers by identifying eligible claims, preparing necessary documentation, and guiding you through the IDR process to help ensure compliance and improve financial outcomes.

Jonathan's love of technology started at an early age with Apple IIs and Commodore 64s. A childhood tinkering in BASIC eventually led to a career in software engineering. As the architect of Fluidity-ai, he oversees every aspect of the platform's code and infrastructure. The company has afforded him the opportunity to design and maintain a modern stack using preferred technologies like React, NextJS, AWS, and TypeScript, and develop artificial intelligence features that are on the cutting edge of the billing industry. Outside of software, he also has an MFA in creative writing from The New School and is a passionate supporter of animal rights. Originally from New Jersey, he now resides in New York's Hudson Valley.
